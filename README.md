# DSA DATA-ANALYSIS-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
📊 DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project.
Welcome to my Data Analysis Capstone Project repository.
A key part of my journey through the Data Analytics program.
This project showcases my ability to apply essential data analysis skills such as data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and business insight generation using industry-standard tools.

🗃 KMS Inventory Data Analysis Project with SQL
This repository contains a SQL-based data analysis project on the KMS Inventory Dataset, focused on uncovering business insights from inventory, sales, customer, and shipping records.

📌 Project Objective
To analyze the KMS inventory and sales database using SQL to answer key business questions, identify trends, detect inefficiencies, and support data-driven decision-making.

 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Microsoft SQL Server 
 SQL (Joins,  Aggregations, Subqueries)

🗂 Dataset Description
The project uses multiple tables, including:

orders – order details

customers – customer information and segments

inventory – product stock levels 

sales – transaction records

shipping – delivery method and cost

returns – returned items etc

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Identified top-selling and low-performing products

Analyzed returned items by customer and segment

Investigated shipping costs vs. delivery speed

Evaluated revenue contribution by region and order priority

Joined multiple tables to track full order lifecycle


📈 Business Insights

Express Air is the fastest but most expensive shipping method

Delivery Truck is the most economical but slowest

Certain customers consistently return products – further investigation is recommended

Bottom 10 customers generate the least revenue – targeted marketing may help

Order priority influences shipping method choice and cost efficiency


✨ Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to write complex SQL queries, join large tables, and interpret business insights from structured datasets.
