🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Identified top-selling and low-performing products

Analyzed returned items by customer and segment

Investigated shipping costs vs. delivery speed

Evaluated revenue contribution by region and order priority

Joined multiple tables to track full order lifecycle


📈 Business Insights

Express Air is the fastest but most expensive shipping method

Delivery Truck is the most economical but slowest

Certain customers consistently return products – further investigation is recommended

Bottom 10 customers generate the least revenue – targeted marketing may help

Order priority influences shipping method choice and cost efficiency


✨ Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to write complex SQL queries, join large tables, and interpret business insights from structured datasets.
